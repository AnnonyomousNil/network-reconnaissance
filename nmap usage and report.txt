Nmap is a free open source tool used for network reconnaissance. It helps in scanning or performing service detection in a network to find vulnerabilities. This is how you can use it
First we will find our IP address range
We will simply type ifconfig in the terminal in Linux

root@debian:/home/kali# ifconfig
eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.230.136  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.230.255
        inet6 fe80::20c:29ff:fecb:9fb8  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 00:0c:29:cb:9f:b8  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 26200  bytes 19449699 (18.5 MiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 67093  bytes 4425663 (4.2 MiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

lo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>  mtu 65536
        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
        inet6 ::1  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x10<host>
        loop  txqueuelen 1000  (Local Loopback)
        RX packets 12038  bytes 506168 (494.3 KiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 12038  bytes 506168 (494.3 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0


Now the ip range as seen above can be noted as 192.168.230.0-192.168.230.255.
So we will use nmap -sS 192.168.230.0/24 as its range to find open ports by performing TCP SYN scan.

root@debian:/home/kali# nmap -sS 192.168.230.0/24
